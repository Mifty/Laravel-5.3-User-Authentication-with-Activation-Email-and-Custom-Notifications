# Laravel 5.3 Login throttling and reCAPTCHA Integration
A sample application that allows people to register, and once they are registered, they receive an email to confirm their account. Once the user has activated their account, they can then login. We must also take care of users who forget their password or their username. Finally, we update the user through various email notifications if anything happens to their account.
